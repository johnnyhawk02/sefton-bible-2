# Example New Page

> **Adding content is easy!** This is a demonstration of how simple it is to add new content to the Reception Bible app.

## Automatic Discovery

When you add this file to the `/content` folder:

1. It appears in the sidebar automatically
2. A new route is created at `/example-new-page`
3. Hot reload updates the app immediately
4. No code changes needed!

## Content Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive filenames (they become the URL)
- Write in GitHub-flavored Markdown
- Include proper headings for navigation
- Keep content focused and scannable for tablet users

## That's It!

Just save this file and watch it appear in the sidebar!
