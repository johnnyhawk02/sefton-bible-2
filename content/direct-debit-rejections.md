# Direct Debit Rejections

> Complete guide to handling direct debit rejections, payment failures, and membership changes with our in-house system.

## Why We Moved Direct Debit In-House

**Cheaper:** Cuts costs by ~50%, lets us invest in better services.

**Better Communication:** Fewer delays and clearer payment info.

**Real-Time Updates:** Now linked with Gladstone system – alerts everyone instantly if a payment fails.

## When a Payment Fails (BACS Statuses)

### 1. "Refer to Payer"

**Account flagged.**

Email sent with:
- Link to update details
- How to pay at centre
- Shows under "Unpaid Debts" at check-in

**7-day deadline to fix or:**
- Membership cancelled
- Must rejoin from scratch
- £10 admin fee

### 2. "Instruction Cancelled"

Same actions as "Refer to Payer".

**Reception prompt:** Ask member to contact Retention and check bank details.

### 3. "No Instruction"

Same process as above.

Also prompts reception to advise checking bank details.

## Debt Payment Process

1. **Add unpaid fee** to member's basket in Gladstone
2. **Member pays** at desk or via chosen method
3. **After payment:**
   - Change status from 'Fees Owed' to 'Current' in their profile
   - Ensures next direct debit goes through properly

## Resending System Emails (Check-In Screen)

Go to **Options > View** to see and resend automated emails.

**If member didn't get it:**
1. Check their email address is correct
2. Update if needed, then resend
3. Check the Sales tab for outstanding fees

**Payment Status:**
- If it says **"Sub - ****"**, it's a membership payment
- Once paid, it shows as **Paid**
